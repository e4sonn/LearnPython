So far in this module, we've covered arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. Now, we introduce another useful category: **membership operators**. These operators are used to test whether a specific value or sequence is found within another sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) or collection (like a set or dictionary keys).

Membership operators return a Boolean value: \`True\` if the value is found in the sequence/collection, and \`False\` otherwise.

Python has two membership operators: \`in\` and \`not in\`.

**1. \`in\` Operator**

The \`in\` operator evaluates to \`True\` if it finds a variable's value in the specified sequence or collection. Otherwise, it evaluates to \`False\`.

**Syntax:** \`value in sequence\`

**Examples:**

*   **With Strings:** Checks if a substring is present within a larger string.
    \`\`\`python
    message = "Hello, Python World!"

    is_python_present = "Python" in message
    print(f"Is 'Python' in message? {is_python_present}")  # Output: Is 'Python' in message? True

    is_java_present = "Java" in message
    print(f"Is 'Java' in message? {is_java_present}")    # Output: Is 'Java' in message? False

    # Note: String membership is case-sensitive
    is_python_lower_present = "python" in message # 'python' (lowercase) is not 'Python' (uppercase P)
    print(f"Is 'python' in message? {is_python_lower_present}") # Output: Is 'python' in message? False

    empty_string_check = "" in message # An empty string is considered to be a substring of any string
    print(f"Is '' in message? {empty_string_check}") # Output: Is '' in message? True
    \`\`\`

*   **With Lists:** Checks if an item is an element of the list.
    \`\`\`python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

    is_banana_in_fruits = "banana" in fruits
    print(f"Is 'banana' in fruits? {is_banana_in_fruits}") # Output: Is 'banana' in fruits? True

    is_grape_in_fruits = "grape" in fruits
    print(f"Is 'grape' in fruits? {is_grape_in_fruits}")   # Output: Is 'grape' in fruits? False

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    is_3_in_numbers = 3 in numbers
    print(f"Is 3 in numbers? {is_3_in_numbers}")           # Output: Is 3 in numbers? True
    \`\`\`

*   **With Tuples:** Similar to lists, checks if an item is an element of the tuple.
    \`\`\`python
    colors_tuple = ("red", "green", "blue")

    is_green_present = "green" in colors_tuple
    print(f"Is 'green' in colors_tuple? {is_green_present}") # Output: Is 'green' in colors_tuple? True

    is_yellow_present = "yellow" in colors_tuple
    print(f"Is 'yellow' in colors_tuple? {is_yellow_present}") # Output: Is 'yellow' in colors_tuple? False
    \`\`\`

*   **With Sets:** Checks if an item is a member of the set. Sets are particularly efficient for membership testing.
    \`\`\`python
    allowed_users_set = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}

    user1 = "Alice"
    user2 = "David"

    print(f"Is {user1} an allowed user? {user1 in allowed_users_set}") # Output: Is Alice an allowed user? True
    print(f"Is {user2} an allowed user? {user2 in allowed_users_set}") # Output: Is David an allowed user? False
    \`\`\`

*   **With Dictionaries:** The \`in\` operator, when used with a dictionary, checks for membership in the **keys** of the dictionary by default.
    \`\`\`python
    student_grades = {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85, "Eve": 92}

    is_alice_a_student = "Alice" in student_grades # Checks if "Alice" is a key
    print(f"Is Alice a student (key)? {is_alice_a_student}") # Output: Is Alice a student (key)? True

    is_charlie_a_student = "Charlie" in student_grades
    print(f"Is Charlie a student (key)? {is_charlie_a_student}") # Output: Is Charlie a student (key)? False

    # To check for membership in values, you need to explicitly use student_grades.values()
    is_grade_90_present = 90 in student_grades.values()
    print(f"Is grade 90 present in values? {is_grade_90_present}") # Output: Is grade 90 present in values? True
    \`\`\`

**2. \`not in\` Operator**

The \`not in\` operator is the logical opposite of \`in\`. It evaluates to \`True\` if it does **not** find a variable's value in the specified sequence or collection. Otherwise (if the value is found), it evaluates to \`False\`.

**Syntax:** \`value not in sequence\`

**Examples:**

*   **With Strings:**
    \`\`\`python
    sentence = "The quick brown fox."

    is_dog_not_in_sentence = "dog" not in sentence
    print(f"Is 'dog' not in sentence? {is_dog_not_in_sentence}") # Output: Is 'dog' not in sentence? True

    is_fox_not_in_sentence = "fox" not in sentence
    print(f"Is 'fox' not in sentence? {is_fox_not_in_sentence}")   # Output: Is 'fox' not in sentence? False
    \`\`\`

*   **With Lists:**
    \`\`\`python
    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

    is_50_not_in_numbers = 50 not in numbers
    print(f"Is 50 not in numbers? {is_50_not_in_numbers}") # Output: Is 50 not in numbers? True

    is_20_not_in_numbers = 20 not in numbers
    print(f"Is 20 not in numbers? {is_20_not_in_numbers}") # Output: Is 20 not in numbers? False
    \`\`\`

*   **With Dictionaries (checks keys by default):**
    \`\`\`python
    config = {"host": "localhost", "port": 8080}

    is_user_not_a_key = "user" not in config
    print(f"Is 'user' not a key in config? {is_user_not_a_key}") # Output: Is 'user' not a key in config? True

    is_port_not_a_key = "port" not in config
    print(f"Is 'port' not a key in config? {is_port_not_a_key}")   # Output: Is 'port' not a key in config? False
    \`\`\`

**Use Cases for Membership Operators**

Membership operators are frequently used in conditional statements to control program flow:

\`\`\`python
user_permissions = ["read", "write"]
requested_action = "execute"

if requested_action in user_permissions:
    print(f"User has permission to {requested_action}.")
else:
    print(f"Access denied. User does not have permission to {requested_action}.")

# Example: Validating input
valid_choices = {"a", "b", "c"}
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (a, b, or c): ").lower()

if user_choice in valid_choices:
    print(f"You chose a valid option: {user_choice}")
else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

# Example: Avoiding processing if an item is missing
required_key = "username"
data_packet = {"id": 123, "payload": "some data"}

if required_key not in data_packet:
    print(f"Error: Required key \r√°sok{required_key}" is missing from data packet.")
else:
    print(f"Processing username: {data_packet[required_key]}") # This line would error if key is missing and not checked
\`\`\`

**Efficiency Considerations**

*   For \`list\` and \`tuple\` types, checking for membership (\`in\` or \`not in\`) involves iterating through the elements until a match is found (or the end is reached). In the worst case, this can take time proportional to the length of the sequence (O(n) complexity).
*   For \`set\` and \`dict\` (checking keys), membership testing is highly optimized and typically takes constant time on average (O(1) complexity), regardless of the size of the set or dictionary. This is because sets and dictionary keys are implemented using hash tables.

Therefore, if you need to perform many membership tests on a large collection of items, and the order doesn't matter, converting a list to a set first can significantly improve performance.

\`\`\`python
large_list = list(range(1000000)) # A list with a million numbers
large_set = set(large_list)       # A set with a million numbers

# Checking membership in a large list can be slower
# print(999999 in large_list)

# Checking membership in a large set is typically much faster
# print(999999 in large_set)
\`\`\`

**Conclusion**

Membership operators (\`in\` and \`not in\`) provide a clean and readable way to check for the presence or absence of a value within various sequence and collection types in Python. They are essential for writing conditional logic, validating data, and controlling program flow based on whether an item exists within a group. Understanding their behavior with different data types (especially dictionaries) and their performance characteristics will help you write more efficient and effective Python code.
